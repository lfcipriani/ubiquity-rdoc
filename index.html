		<li>2009-04-07: set previewDelay to 800 miliseconds, improve on usability</li>
		<li>2009-02-25: added 'rdoc-unload' command and some usability improvements</li>
		<li>2009-01-04: highlight in first item of suggestion list, and a bugfix on rdoc-load validation</li>
		<li>2008-12-10: better searching on methods and classes: [implemented the '#' modifier to do a advanced search on Class#method. Try it searching for 'rdoc String#delete in ruby' to see an example. You could also ommit the class or method like '#delete' or 'String#'.]</li>
		<li>2008-12-09: persist user loaded rdoc data in browser: [default rdoc and rdoc indexes are stored on browser preferences, no need to reload each time the browser starts]</li>

	<h2>What is Ubiquity-RDoc?</h2>
	<p>A set of <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/">Mozilla Ubiquity</a> commands for searching on Ruby rdocs.</p>
	
	<h2>How to use this command?</h2>
	<p>Do the following steps:</p>
	
	<h3>1. Install and learn Ubiquity</h3>
	<p>Install: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity">Mozilla Ubiquity Wiki</a><br />
       Learn: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Latest_Ubiquity_User_Tutorial">Ubiquity User Tutorial</a><br />

       Nice and easy.</p>
	
	<h3>2. Install Ubiquity-RDoc</h3>
	<p>After install Ubiquity, just access this page and follow the steps in 
	<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Latest_Ubiquity_User_Tutorial#Teaching_Ubiquity_New_Commands">Teaching Ubiquity New Commands</a></p>
	
	<h3>3. Use it</h3>
	<p>Ok, let's suppose that we want to read the description of "delete" method in rails, 
		just start typing 'rdoc delete' and a box will show some suggestions:</p>
	<img src="images/Picture_1.png" alt="rdoc delete" />
	<p>But, in fact, we really want to access the "delete" method of <b>ruby</b> rdoc. Just continue typing 'in ruby'</p>
	<img src="images/Picture_2.png" alt="rdoc delete in ruby" />
	<p>Yes, rdoc command could switch the rdoc used on searching by just adding the modifier 'in + [rdoc name]'</p>
	<p>Then, to access the documentation you could click an item or press enter to access 
		the first item of the list. In the following picture, we clicked on "delete (String)" method.</p>
	<img src="images/Picture_3.png" alt="rdoc delete in ruby after clicking on delete (String)" />
	<p>Ubiquity-RDoc is released with rails and ruby rdocs, but, if you already know 
		every method or class of these libraries and need to search on a different rdoc (for example, rspec), 
		don't worry, you can load it by simply typing 'rdoc-load + [base URL] + as + [rdoc name]':</p>
	<img src="images/Picture_4.png" alt="loading rspec to rdoc search command" />
	<p>Base URL is the main page address of the rdoc, without 'index.html'. 
		RDoc name is the name that you want to use when searching rdoc command, you can
		 overwrite an existent rdoc index by just typing the same name used by rdoc command.</p>	
	<p> You could also use the 'rdoc-unload'  command to remove unused rdocs.</p>
	<p>Now, we can search on rspec documentation:</p>
	<img src="images/Picture_5.png" alt="searching on rspec" />
	<p>Finally, you could also change the default rdoc name used in searches. Type 'rdoc-default rspec'</p>
	<img src="images/Picture_6.png" alt="changing default rdoc" />
	<p>And then, rdoc delete</p>
	<img src="images/Picture_7.png" alt="search rdoc rspec" />
	
	<h2>TODO</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>method or class description preview</li>
		<li>search on all rdocs with 'rdoc delete in all' and 'rdoc-default all'</li>
	</ul>
